# BlinDrone
- Drone Project by using Tello Drone
### Project duration : 10/2022 - 11/2022

## Project Description
- Pet drone for the visually impaired
- Control the drone through hand gestures
- Voice output to guide the operation of the drone

## Difficulties
- Drone doesnâ€™t have speaker  
-> Check the sound through a laptop

- Hardware capacity limits   
-> Processing image transfer and mediapipe module in parallel  
-> Face detection and hand recognition in parallel

- The more gestures it uses, the lower the recognition rate  
-> Using an already trained deep learning model

## Further Improvements
- Put the camera in front and back of the drone 
  - Recognize hand gesture
  - Identify the surrounding obstacles

- Ensure safety itself
  - Add the sensor, calculating distances
